# deploy-signal-server
deploy all signal server components on your own servers.

Due to the high security of the Signal protocol, I believe some people might be interested in running Signal on their own servers. On my end, I have successfully deployed a complete Signal server on my own server (around late April 2025), including the storage service (modified implementation), tusd (reimplemented), registration (reimplemented), coturn && SFU, as well as three clients: Android, Desktop, and iOS. If anyone is interested, I can provide technical support.
